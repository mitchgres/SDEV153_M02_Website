                    What is a yurt?
            </dt>
            <dd>
                Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome that can be opened, and a private deck.

                    How are the yurts furnished?
            </dt>
            <dd>
                Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down quilt, comfy couch, dining table and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience includes a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom
                facilities are located in the lodge.

                    What should I bring?
            </dt>

            <dd>
                Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
